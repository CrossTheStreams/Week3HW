1. Pretty good! What usually slips me up in iOS development is missing an option somewhere in Interface Builder. For example, it's really easy to miss the Identifier field for table view cells.
2. The XCode documentation! Perhaps more specifically this time around, the documentation for `NSTableView`.
3. I can't think of a question this time around, but to comment, it's interesting to see how MVC works in iOS, as compared to RoR or Javascript development. It's very similar, but the ViewController is what gives its distinct flavor. In iOS development, the developer seeks to make ViewController interact with the user interface without knowledge about model objects. This is very similar to how RoR controller actions should be about responding to requests without knowing details about what should happen to model objects.
